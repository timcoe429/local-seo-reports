    "critical_finding": "<strong>Charlotte represents a significant competitive threat and opportunity.</strong> Multiple well-established competitors (Viking Dumpsters - 260 reviews, Bin There Dump That - 278 reviews) are positioned closer to Charlotte and capturing premium urban market share.

    "what_this_means": "Domain Authority (DA) is a predictive metric developed by Moz that indicates how likely your website is to rank in search engine results. Scores range from 1-100, with higher scores corresponding to greater ranking ability. Your DA of 11 provides a baseline competitive position but indicates significant room for improvement.",
    "why_it_matters": "DA directly impacts organic search visibility. Websites with higher DA scores rank above lower-scoring competitors for the same keywords. This translates to more website traffic, more leads, and more revenue. Your competitors with DA scores above 15-20 are capturing traffic that could be yours.",

      "Create linkable content assets",
      "Partner with complementary businesses for mutual linking"
    ],
    "key_insight": "With 856 backlinks from 124 domains, your link acquisition velocity is strong. However, Trust Flow matching Domain Authority at 11 suggests these are primarily lower-authority links. Focus should shift to acquiring fewer, higher-quality links from authoritative sources (DA 40+) such as local news outlets, chamber of commerce, or industry associations."
  },
  "citations": {
    "screenshot": "",
    "what_this_means": "Citations are online mentions of your business Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) across directories, websites, and platforms. Complete and consistent citations signal to Google that your business is legitimate and established. Currently, only 11 of 73 key citations (15%) are active.",
    "why_it_matters": "Citations are one of the top 3 ranking factors for local search. Missing citations mean missed visibility opportunities. Additionally, 2 NAP errors (inconsistent business information) confuse search engines and dilute ranking power. Competitors with complete citation profiles rank higher by default.",
    "how_to_improve": [
      "Submit to remaining 62 directories immediately",
      "Correct NAP inconsistencies across all platforms",
      "Claim and optimize unclaimed listings",
      "Set up ongoing citation monitoring"
    ],
    "warning": "<strong>The 85% citation gap represents low-hanging fruit.</strong> Completing these citations typically improves local rankings within 30-60 days. This is one of the fastest ROI improvements available.

    "why_it_matters": "Reviews are one of the top 3 local ranking factors and critically impact conversion rates. 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Your perfect rating builds immediate trust and differentiates you from competitors with 4.7-4.9 ratings. Review velocity (rate of new reviews) also impacts rankings.",

      "Target 10-15 new reviews monthly",

    ],
    "key_insight": "<strong>Your 178 reviews far exceed most local competitors</strong> (Lake Wylie: 36 reviews, Willow Dumpsters: 29 reviews). This volume combined with perfect rating creates powerful social proof. However, with 0 new reviews recently, maintaining momentum is critical. Consistent review generation signals ongoing customer satisfaction to both Google and potential customers.",

    "why_it_matters": "75% of users never scroll past the first page of search results, and 44% of local searches result in a visit/purchase within 24 hours.
